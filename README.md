# Task-1-Individual-Activity
Web Development Individual Task ( Mobile Bar - Booking Form) by Angel Aco of BSIT 3-5

As a part-timer working student at this Mobile Bar, I've observed the challenges associated with our booking system. Inspired by the need for improvement, I am motivated to create a Booking Form as my Individual Activity in the subject Web Development.  I intend to develop and propose this solution to our boss during my upcoming vacation. Hoping it will happen soon and lead to a more streamlined and efficient booking process.
